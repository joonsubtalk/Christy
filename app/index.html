              <p>Christy Hae-Jin Kang (67) was the eldest of three born in Seoul, Korea March 11, 1949 to pastor Do-soon Kang and Hyun-Sang Il. She was born in a time of turmoil, a poverty struck Korea, due to the Korean War. However, that didn’t stop her from pursuing her passion in entrepreneurship even when Korea was strongly against industrially successful women. Her hobby was to travel and had always dreamed of achieving her goals in America.</p>

          <p>In 1975, that dream was fulfilled – Christy arrived to America. Christy embarked on a journey in obtaining multiple degrees: She received a degree in business, cosmetology, and theology all with high honors. As decorated as she was, she was also a compassionate, faithful, and loving friend, sister, and aunt. She was a faithful prayer warrior always keeping others before her. She faithfully served the youth with Bible lessons.</p>
