              <p>Christy Hae-Jin Kang (67) was born in Seoul, Korea March 11, 1949 to pastor Do-soon Kang and Hyun-Sang Il. She was the eldest of three. Due to the Korean War, her early years were filled with turmoil. However, that didn't stop her from pursuing her passion in entrepreneurship even when Korea was strongly against industrially successful women. Her hobby was to travel and she had always dreamed of achieving her goals in America.</p>

              On January 12, 2017, Christy passed away suddenly. Although we are all grieving for her, Christy's winning smile and loving spirit will never be forgotten. What we'll all remember most about her was her great love for our Lord and her genuine concern for others and their eternal well being. Though many may not have been aware of it, Christy was always praying for others. We thank God for the many lives Christy touched and the many more who are now rejoicing with her in Glory.
